            This is one of my favorite verse from Yung Gravy. This verse
            summarizes the whole persona and theme of Yung Gravy. He is a rapper
            whose songs are about having sex with your mom, sister, grandma, or
            even you dentist.
          </p>

          <p>
            What makes Yung Gravy popular isn't just the use of these bizzare
            lyrics, it is the fact that he takes himself seriously. You can feel
            that he means what he raps and his persona matches with it. This is
            shown with his unquie sense of fashion style, which I would describe
            as gucci for your dad, aka high fashion from the 1970s. Another
            aspect is that the production quality in his music is very high, and
            the songs are the kind that you love or hate that you love them.
